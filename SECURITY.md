## Philosophy

FreeFlow is built with decentralization, privacy, and user safety in mind. We welcome white-hat contributions and will prioritize vulnerabilities that affect:

- Device deanonymization
- Ledger tampering (PoCCA)
- Relay manipulation or DoS vectors
- Cryptographic exploits

Let’s build a resilient and censorship-resistant world together.
